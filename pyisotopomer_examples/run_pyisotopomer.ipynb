Given the right reference materials, it is not necessary to use a numerical algorithm to solve for γ and κ; algebraic manipulations can provide exact and unique solutions for each coefficient. This algebraic solution is the default method of calculation of γ and κ in pyisotopomer. It should be noted that this algebraic solution produces consistent results only when the site preferences of the two reference materials used in the calculation are sufficiently distinct — otherwise, it will return values of γ and κ that vary widely and may not fall in the range of plausible values (i.e., they are either negative or greater than one).\n","\n","In the event that the user has yet to obtain reference materials that are different enough in their site preferences to produce consistent results with the algebraic method, the least squares approach can be used as a temporary alternative, with the following caveats and modifications:\n"," - The least squares solver finds a local minimum close to the initial guess for γ and κ. As such, if the solver is fed an initial guess other than the absolute minimum calculated from the algebraic solution, it will find the “wrong” scrambling coefficients.\n"," - Using these “wrong” scrambling coefficients is OK if your unknowns are close in their delta values to those of the reference materials, but will have a deleterious effect as the unknowns diverge in their isotopomer values from the reference materials.\n"," - If the least squares solver is fed the correct γ and κ as an initial guess, it will converge on that solution — although this is still not as robust as simply running reference materials of sufficiently distinct site preferences and calculating γ and κ algebraically.\n","\n","The import convention for pyisotopomer is (hold down shift-enter to run the cell):"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from pyisotopomer import Scrambling, Isotopomers"],"metadata":{"id":"lGIeVtM13BXg"},"id":"lGIeVtM13BXg","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The algebraic method is the default and does not require any modifications to the call to the Scrambling function.
